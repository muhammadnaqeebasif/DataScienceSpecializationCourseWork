My First R Markdown File
=======================

This is my first R markdown file.

Here we're going to load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Let's first make pair plots of the data

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of wind,solar radiation and temperature

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone~Wind+Solar.R + Temp,data=airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's an unordered list:

* First element
* Second Element
