# Exploratory Analysis on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) storm database
Severe weather events bring catastrophe with them. They can be drastic to human lives and can cause great damage to the economy. So it is better to be prepared for the severe weather events beforehand and take extra precautions for the events which do the most damage.
The aim of this project is to explore U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) storm database and find out which event causes the most damage to the human lives and economy.
After analysing the database it was found out that the most damage to the human lives was done by tornadoes and the most damage done to the economy was by the floods.
